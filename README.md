## Hi, I'm Sang-Heon Jeon @lntuition 

- Using **Kotlin + Spring** to develop web-backend
  - I'm paying attention to testing and making boundary in order to write robust and scalable code.
  - I don't think there is a silver bullet in software development, and I always try to find a reasonable solution.
- Studying **Rust** as a hobby
- Used **Python** to develop web-backend and libraries
  - Some contribution to [tortoise-orm](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm), [pypika](https://github.com/kayak/pypika), [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
