## Hi, I'm Sang-Heon Jeon @hqsz 

- Using **Kotlin + Spring** to develop Back-end product
  - I always consider writing `readable` code to be extremely important.
  - I believe that tests are crucial for solving many issues during development, and I put significant effort into creating structures that are `easy to test`.
  - I don't believe there's a silver bullet in development, so I strive to find `reasonable` solutions.
  - I believe that identifying boundaries in code leads to more `maintainable` code.
